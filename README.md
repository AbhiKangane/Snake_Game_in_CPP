# Snake_Game_in_CPP
I created a snake game in C++ language without using any graphics. Code of this game is totally based on OOPs concept in C++.
Where I have created 2 classes named as Snake &amp; Food. 
(1) Class Snake has member function are :- change_dir(), move_snake(), get_pos(), eaten(pos), grow(), collided(), get_Body(), etc. 
(2) Class Food has member functions are:- gen_food(), get_pos().
Also board() function is used to display the board or our game.
